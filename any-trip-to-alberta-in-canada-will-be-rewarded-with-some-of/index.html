<p>You’ll visit the wine regions of Okanagan Valley then cross into Alberta to the glorious sandy beaches of Shuswap Lake and then onto the desolate beauty of Wells Gray Provincial Park. There are over 150 waterfalls in this wild wilderness that is home to a vast array of animals including bears, moose, deer, eagles, hawks, cranes and Canada geese. </p><p>The final week of the holiday takes in Jasper National Park, the Icefields Parkway and all that is has to offer, Lake Louise and Banff before heading to Calgary where you’ll be able to drop off your motorhome before heading home. This added self drive flexibility enables you to see so much more of the country in the time available.</p><p></p><p>Whatever the time of year Alberta is one of those destinations that never fails to impress – not only are you guaranteed to be blown away by the awe inspiring scenery and excellent activities, you’re sure to receive a friendly welcome from everybody you meet along the way. </p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="14"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="15"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="16"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="17"><span data-reactid="18"><!-- react-empty: 19 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="20"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="21"></a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="22"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="23"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="24"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
