Any trip to Alberta in
Canada will be rewarded with some of the most stunning scenery you're ever
likely to see. Craggy peaks jutting into clear blue skies, mountain lakes,
sweeping valleys, cascading waterfalls and impressive glaciers snaking through
the majestic landscape.

Combine this with cosmopolitan cities and a warm and welcoming people and you've got one of the best all year round destinations on the planet. With so much on offer it pays to leave it to the experts to tailor-make your itinerary - Trailfinders have been organising holidays here for many years and their local knowledge is second to none.

They run a number of trips that showcase all this wonderful region has to offer and their Rocky Mountain Wanderer is no exception. This 7 day fly, drive excursion takes in the country's beautiful National Parks whilst allowing you to experience city life as well. Travelling by car is undoubtedly one of the best ways to explore giving you the freedom and flexibility to take each day as it comes. 

The trip starts in the lively city of Calgary -- if you visit in July you'll be able to experience the cowboy extravaganza that is the Calgary Stampede. Attracting over 1 million visitors every year this ten day event features one of the largest rodeos in the world, chuckwagon racing and a parade with over 130 floats.

The drive to Banff through the National Park that bears its name is where the sheer magnificence of Alberta's scenery becomes apparent -- a backdrop of craggy snow capped mountains and dense forest dotted with emerald lakes. By the time you reach the lovely alpine town of Lake Louise and join The Icefields Parkway the landscape becomes -- somewhat amazingly - even more impressive. 

Along its 141 mile length there are over 100 glaciers including the Columbia Icefield, spellbinding waterfalls such as the 

Athabasca and Sunwapta Falls, and the Glacier Sky Walk - a vertigo inducing glass-floored observation platform perched some 918 feet over the Sunwapta Valley.

Trailfinders Canadian Rockies Winter Wonderland is a 14 day holiday that follows the same route as the 

Rocky Mountain Wanderer 

but allows for more time to immerse yourself in the beauty of Alberta during the winter months. 

Highlights include taking a ride on the Banff Gondola to the observation decks at the summit of Sulphur Mountain -- the views are truly astounding.

You can have a go at Ice skating on Lake Louise or take a horse drawn carriage across its frozen surface. 

The slopes in Marmot Basin ski resort offer something for everybody, regardless of experience or ability, and the town has many fine restaurants and comfy pubs to recharge after a day's exertions. This trip is rounded off with a night in the secluded Emerald Lake Lodge in the stunning Yoho National Park for complete and utter downtime.

Both of these holidays include accommodation that has been carefully selected with your comfort and convenience in mind. However, for something slightly different why not take advantage of Canada's excellent network of campsites to travel and sleep in a motorhome? This is an ever popular way to get about and is also a great way to meet fellow travellers as most sites have shared facilities such as BBQ areas and playgrounds.

Trailfinders' 12 day West Canada Wonders Motorhome Holiday starts in Vancouver -- this splendid city is regularly voted as being one of the best places to live in the world -- and it's not hard to see why with its fabulously upbeat vibe and superb location sandwiched between the mighty Pacific Ocean and the Rockies.

You'll visit the wine regions of Okanagan Valley then cross into Alberta to the glorious sandy beaches of Shuswap Lake and then onto the desolate beauty of Wells Gray Provincial Park. There are over 150 waterfalls in this wild wilderness that is home to a vast array of animals including bears, moose, deer, eagles, hawks, cranes and Canada geese. 

The final week of the holiday takes in Jasper National Park, the Icefields Parkway and all that is has to offer, Lake Louise and Banff before heading to Calgary where you'll be able to drop off your motorhome before heading home. This added self drive flexibility enables you to see so much more of the country in the time available.

Whatever the
time of year Alberta is one of those destinations that never fails to impress --
not only are you guaranteed to be blown away by the awe inspiring scenery and
excellent activities, you're sure to receive a friendly welcome from everybody
you meet along the way.
